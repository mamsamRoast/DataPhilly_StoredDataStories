[1.] maybe not recently, but it has run ... at least, I remember it running   
[2.] should a *bug* be found (the chances of which are small ... OK ... small-*ish*), workshop attendees are invited to accept the bug as a *learning opportunity*

"Don't get discouraged because there's a lot of mechanical work to writing. There is, and you can't get out of it. I rewrote the first part of 'A Farewell to Arms' at least fifty times. You've got to work it over. The first draft of anything is sh*t. When you first start to write you get all the kick and the reader gets none, but after you learn to work, it's your object to convey everything to the reader so that he remembers it not as a story he had read but something that happened to himself."  
- Ernest Hemingway
